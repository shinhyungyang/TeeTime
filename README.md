## Build TeeTime by Yourself

TeeTime requires an existing Maven and JDK installation.

Simply execute "./gradlew build"

## TeeTime Release Train

- Create a release branch based on the version number with the prefix -RC, e.g., 3.1.2-RC
- Set the `teeTimeVersion` in `gradle.properties` to the release version, e.g., 3.1.2  (without RC)
- Build TeeTime locally, `./gradlew build`

- Ensure that the version/revision is set
- Run this script, if no errors occur, continue
- login to nexus with the credentials below https://oss.sonatype.org/
- Click on "Staging Repositories"
- There should be a new deposit, if not wait a little and reload the page
- If nothing shows up something went horribly wrong or you have your build.gradle
  file still set to publish locally.
- Select the deposit, it should be open if the step went fine you get an email.
- Now click on "close" (button bar above the list of deposits)
- Wait, after a while reload the page
- If closing failed check the issues and fix them, rerun the ./publish.sh
- If it worked, click on "release"
